       <h2>History of Lisp</h2>
        <p>Lisp is the second eldest programming language 
            in the computer science world, next to Fortran. 
            Lisp is most commonly used for AI and solving 
            complex mathematical problems. The language was 
            created by computer scientist John McCarthy at 
            MIT in 1959 as part of his artificial intelligence 
            research there. After Lisp was created, various 
            individuals and organizations changed Lisp to fit 
            specific computational needs and purposes. These 
            variations of the Lisp language became what we 
            refer to as "dialects." Below are some 
            (but not all) of the dialects that fall 
            into the Lisp category:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Common Lisp
            </li>

                Arc
            </li>
            <li>
                AutoLisp
            </li>

            Fun fact: Lisp is an acronym for "List Processing." <br>

        <h2>Where is Lisp Used?</h2>
            <P>While it is true that Lisp may be rather old, 
                it is not true that the language is useless. 
                Below are some examples of where Lisp is being used currently: 
            </P>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Lisp is commonly used in academics as a tool to study AI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grammarly, a text-editing web service 
                    students and professionals use, incorporates Lisp in its code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boeing commercial aircraft use Lisp-based servers to function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roomba, an automated vacuum by iRobot, uses a code subset of Common Lisp.
                </li>
              </ul>
