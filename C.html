       <h2>A Brief History of C#</h2>
        <p>C# is an object-oriented language created in 2002 by a team of engineers 
            from Microsoft. The leaders of this team of engineers were Anders 
            Heilsburg and Scott Wiltaumot. C# was designed by Microsoft to be 
            its flagship language: accessible, versatile, and easy to learn. 
            Over the years since 2002, Microsoft has continued to release updates 
            for C#, with each update adding something new to optimize the language. 
            The timeline of C# releases is as follows:

        <h2>Applicability of C#...Where Can C# Be Used?</h2>
            <P>There are a myriad of possibilities for C#'s use. 
                The language can be used for IOS/Android app development, 
                Cybersecurity, windows app creation, web app creation, 
                and even game development. Additionally, not only is 
                C# utilized by Microsoft and its programs but also by 
                professional developers because of its language efficiency. 
            </P>
