       <h2>The History of PHP</h2>
        <p>PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf as a personal project. 
        PHP was initially written in C and was used by Lerdorf to track visits to his online resume.
         A year later, in 1995, Lerdorf rewrote PHP and released it to the public as "PHP FI." Since then, 
        PHP has undergone multiple revisions by other developers to improve its functionality and versatility. 
        PHP has had numerous iterations over the years in terms of build releases:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP FI</strong> (1995)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP FI 2.0</strong> (1997)         
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP 3.0</strong> (1998)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP 4.0</strong> (1999)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP 5.0</strong> (2004)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP7.0</strong> (2015)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PHP 8.0</strong> (2020)
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p> The significant time gap between the PHP 5.0, 7.0, and 8.0 versions is attributed to the
        extensive number of iterations launched between each. It is also worth noting that the 
        release of PHP version 3.0 changed the acronym's meaning. Initially standing for 
        "personal homepage tools," the abbreviation was updated to mean "hypertext processor." 
        Currently, the latest iteration of PHP is version 8.2.11 (2023).

        <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <P>PHP has come a long way since its humble beginnings and has become an essential 
                component of web development. PHP's cross-platform compatibility and versatility
                 make it popular among developers and programmers. Some of the internet's most 
                 well-known companies, such as Facebook, Etsy, WordPress, and Wikipedia, utilize 
                 the language. Examples of PHP's various uses are:
