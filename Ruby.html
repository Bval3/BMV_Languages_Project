       <h2>A Brief History of Ruby</h2>
        <p>Ruby was invented by Matsumoto Yukihiro, a knowledgeable computer programmer, in 1993. 
            The main goal of Yukihiro when creating the language 
            was to make Ruby a blend of his favorite languages: 
            Ada, Eiffel, Perl, Smalltalk, and Lisp. 
            The earliest official release of Ruby, 
            version 0.95, was made available to the Japanese public in 1995. 
            The newly-conceived language quickly gained popularity in Japan, 
            and word of its existence spread outside the country. 
            The first stable version of Ruby was released in 1998, 
            version 1.2, and around this time, the language gained 
            much recognition in the programming world. By 2005, the 
            "Ruby on Rails" framework was released, and the programming language 
            amassed a gigantic internet following due to its usefulness in webpage 
            application building. Ruby continued to evolve and develop as a language, 
            eventually reaching the latest iteration: Version 3.3.0. 
            Today, the language remains a beloved part of 
            the programming world, still used by developers and programmers alike.

        <h2>Uses and Applications of Ruby</h2>
            <P>Ruby is an Object-oriented scripting language with a wide array of features,
                 making it an incredibly versatile program. Some examples of frequented websites 
                 on the internet that utilize Ruby are Airbnb, Twitch, Github, Instacart, and Groupon. 
                 Additionally, some (but not all) of the things ruby can be used for are:
