       <h2>The History of Rust</h2>
        <p>Graydon Hoare was an employee at Mozilla Research. While 
            working at Mozilla, Hoare wrote Rust as a personal project 
            in 2006. Later, in 2015,  Rust's first stable release was 
            made available to the public five years after its announcement 
            in 2010. Rust is significantly younger than most other programming 
            languages, only 17 years old, so it continues to develop and grow 
            in language maturity. However, despite its youth, Rust already has 
            a promising future ahead of it, as it is sponsored by tech companies 
            around the globe, and it is even used in the Linux kernel. Since its 
            first public release in 2015, Rust has gone from version 1.0 to 1.73.0 
            as of 2023.

        <h2>Uses of Rust</h2>
            <P>Rust can be used in system-level programming, web development,
                 and data science. Rust can be used in system-level programming 
                 for writing operating systems and device drivers. Rust can 
                 also be used in web development to provide backend services 
                 and create web applications. Lastly, Rust is applicable in 
                 data science fields for High-performance computing and machine 
                 learning processes. Currently, Rust is being used by well-known 
                 web services such as Discord, Dropbox, and Cloudflare.
